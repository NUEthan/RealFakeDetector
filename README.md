# Antispoofing/Liveness Detection for Face Recognition

## Overview
This project implements an antispoofing/liveness detection system for face recognition, aimed at distinguishing real faces from fake/spoofed ones. 
It's designed for integration into security systems, providing an additional layer of authentication and fraud prevention.

## Features
- Real vs. fake face detection with high accuracy
- Compatible with various devices (phones, tablets, laptops, computers)
- Fast processing suitable for real-time applications
- Custom-trained using Ultralytics AI on a diverse dataset

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies

## Usage
To run the liveness detection system:
python main.py


## Data Collection
For information on how to collect your own data and train the model, refer to the detailed documentation.
